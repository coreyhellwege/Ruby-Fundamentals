**Repository:**

### **PURPOSE**
___
This is a collection of code challenges, exercises and notes which I have completed to help me learn the Ruby Programming language.

Please feel free to interact with this repository. I would love to see the different ways people solve some of these challenges!

<i>Note: In many cases I have incorporated pseudo code comments in these challenges. The purpose of doing so was to assist my learning and comprehension. Outlining my thought process helped me tackle the challenge by breaking it down into individual steps.</i>

### **HOW TO RUN:**
___
Run each file using Ruby in your terminal. E.G:
```bash
$ ruby main.rb
```
