# Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters. Each night that plant's height decreases by downSpeed meters due to the lack of sun. Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.

def growing_plant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight)
    plant_height = 0
    days_to_reach_height = (desiredHeight * 100) 
end
